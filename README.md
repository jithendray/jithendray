- I'm a data scientist working at the intersection of analytics, business intelligence & machine learning
- I mainly write code in Python and SQL, and currently I am learning Scala.

Here is some of the stuff I enjoy doing:
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Cleaning data
- Machine learning
- Deep Learning for text (NLP)

Here is what keeping me busy while not working:
- Learning to put stuff in production
- Learning about building scalable data systems
- Deep Learning for audio
